A simplified, custom load profile for a hypothetical commercial and industrial installation in Downtown San Francisco. Created by aggregating loads for several warehouses, quick and full service restaurants, large and small offices, large and small hotels, hospitals, OPDs, strip malls, and a few midrise apartments. These load profiles are from the US Department of Energy's Open Data Catalog, which provides a year of kW consumption data for 16 standardised commercial building types as well as residential consumers for all TMY3 locations in the US.
