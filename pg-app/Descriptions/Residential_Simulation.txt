The graph shows the load curve of a single day of 1,000 households with around 12 appliances each, composing thus an amount of approximately 12,000 simulation elements. This type of simulation can provide the relevance of a determined power consumer in the household consumption. 

The 1,000 household sample is composed of a distribution of the different social groups according to real statistical data, in order to obtain a sample of households that is as close as possible to reality. 

Similar to a typical residential load profile, the demand for power increases during the night time of peak load hours (8 PM to 11 PM) because of the lighting load. 

The demand stays capped at around 400 KW during the day time (6 AM to 6 PM), with only occasional peaks occurring due to coincidental operation of heavy appliances. 

While during the sleeping hours (after 12 AM to 5 AM) the demand is the lowest at 200 KW since only fans and air conditioning is used during those hours.
